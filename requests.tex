\section{Requests}
\subsection{Beam condition and beam time}
The test experiment can run parasitically with T2K,
therefore we request no dedicated beam time nor beam condition.


We request XXX POT of $\nu$ (and anti-$\nu$) beam data for the test experiment.
In order to achieve the goals discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:goals}, we would like to use the B2 floor of the near detector hall of the J-PARC neutrino beam-line as a test facility of the neutrino beam.

\subsection{Request of equipment}
We would like to request to use the following equipments by the end of the test experiment.
\begin{itemize}
\item Working space in the neutrino assembly (NA) building for detector construction and commissioning
\item Experimental space for the detectors and the electronics/DAQ in the B2 floor of the near detector hall
\item Electricity (~XXkW) for the electronics/DAQ and the magnet modules of Baby MIND
\item Beam timing signal and spill information
\item Network connection
\end{itemize}
The infrastructure for all these is already existing.
Equipment such as the detector itself will be covered by external funds.
