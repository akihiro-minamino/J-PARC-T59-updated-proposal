\begin{abstract}
We had submitted our proposal of a test experiment to develop a new detector with a water target
at the near detector hall of J-PARC neutrino beamline to J-PARC PAC on April 2014, 
and the proposal was approved as J-PARC T59.
Since there are several updates on the project after three years from then, 
we would like to revise our proposal and resubmit it.


In this test experiment, we will develop a 3D grid-like neutrino detector, WAGASCI, and 
test its basic performance to measure cross sections on water with high precision 
using a neutrino beam.
In the original proposal, we also proposed to measure the neutrino cross sections with the new detector,
but we have decided to submit another proposal for the neutrino cross section measurements to J-PARC PAC.
