\section{Goals of the test experiment}
\label{sec:goals}
We will test the following basic performance of the detector using the neutrino beam data,
and confirm the capability of measuring neutrino cross sections with high precision.
\begin{itemize}
\item Capability of reconstructing charged particle tracks with high efficiency in 4$\pi$ direction.
\item Capability of identifying directions of motion of charged particles from the hit-time difference between the WAGASCI modules and the MRDs (Side-MRD modules and Baby MIND).
\item Track reconstruction efficiency of 99\% for an isolated track longer than 10cm.
\item Particle identification capability, especially for protons and pions or muons, with dE/dx information.
\end{itemize}
Once the above performance is confirmed, we are planning to start neutrino beam measurement with the water-out WAGASCI module.
In the measurement, the water-out WAGASCI module is a full-active neutrino target tracker, and the lower threshold is expected for the low momentum particles with the short tracks, especially for protons and pions.
